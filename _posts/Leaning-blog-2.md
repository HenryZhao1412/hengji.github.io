# GPU setup learning

This is Hengji's learning of how to setup the NVIDIA GPU for Deep Learning.

## Why I need to write this blog? The professor has already provided powerful GPU for our learning.

The first reason is that when I tried to connect to the `Dev Container`, it always failed and show me Figure 1, which makes me feel confused.

Figure 1: The Error message I come across when connecting the `Dev Container`.

Thanks for tutors' help, I can successfully connect to professor's GPU now.

The second reason is the GPU I cannot use for a long time, now I enrolled in ELEC4630, I can use the powerful GPU provided by professor, but in the future, I cannot use the professor's GPU for a lifetime. 

Also, in the future the advanced GPU will be produced, so learning to setup the GPU for Deep Learning is necessary, it is not in the lecture slides but this is important for learning Deep Learning, that's what I think.
